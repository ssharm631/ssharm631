Hi! I’m Sagar — I help build and deploy intelligent systems. My focus: Generative AI, Machine Learning, Robotics, and real-time Computer Vision. Currently, I am working as a Research Assitant/Research Engineer in George Washington University's Assistive Robotics and Tele-medicine Lab, under the guidance of Dr. Chung Hyuk Park.

## ⚙️ What I Do

- Design learning algorithms that enable intelligent systems to make decisions from limited or imperfect data — including generative, self-supervised, and imitation learning approaches.

- Develop robotic systems that integrate AI with real-world sensors and control — from grasp recovery to tactile feedback, navigation, and manipulation.

- Build robust, scalable software stacks using C++ and Python — optimizing for reliability, latency, and real-time operation in dynamic environments.

- Engineer machine learning pipelines for high-stakes domains like healthcare — including data preprocessing, feature selection, model optimization, and evaluation.

- Explore generative AI applications beyond text — applying diffusion models and masked autoencoders to areas like robotic policy learning and data augmentation.

- Drive innovation end-to-end — from research and prototyping to deployment and evaluation, often resulting in [publications or intellectual property.](https://www.ssharma.ai/patents-and-publications)
